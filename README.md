# Impacts of natural disaster on house price

## Introduction to the project
When natural disaster hit, rich and poor neighborhoods recover from it differently. The rebound rate of house price could be an effective index of the recovery rate. What is the gap between the recovery rate between rich and poor neighborhoods? Which city is better at helping the less privileged neighborhood to recover from natural disaster? 

In this project, I propose to study the rebound rate of housing price in neighborhoods with different economic (and/or demographic) characteristics in cities that are stroke by natural disasters (hurricane in New Orleans, wild fire in Los Angelas etc.) The results of these models can be useful for governmental decision regarding disaster relief, and individual decision on housing.
